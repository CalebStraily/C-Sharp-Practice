# C-Sharp-Practice
 
The objective of this project for myself was to use it as a means to improve my understanding of C#, Unity, and PlasticSCM (functions similar to GitHub but with Unity compatibility).

This Unity project attempts to achieve similar functionality to the combat mechanics from the Monster Racher series.
